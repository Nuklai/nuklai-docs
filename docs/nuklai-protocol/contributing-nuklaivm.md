#### Step 1: Find an Issue

Start by looking at the project's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nuklai/nuklaivm/issues). Choose an issue that interests you and matches your skills. If you have a new idea or a bug you've discovered, please create a new issue, ensuring it has not already been reported or addressed.

#### Step 2: Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork the `nuklaivm` repository to your GitHub account and clone it locally to make your changes.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuklaivm.git
cd nuklaivm
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment

Ensure your development environment is set up according to the setup instructions in the repository's README. This may involve installing certain software dependencies, setting up virtual environments, or ensuring compatibility with your local development tools.

#### Step 4: Create a Feature Branch

Always work on a new branch for your changes:

```sh
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

#### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Make the changes in the codebase. Write clean, readable code and adhere to existing coding conventions.

#### Step 6: Test Your Changes

Run the test suite to make sure your changes do not break existing functionality. Add new tests if you are adding new features or fixing bugs.

```sh
./scripts/tests.integration.sh
```

#### Step 7: Commit Your Changes

Write clear, concise commit messages that describe your changes. Here’s a good example:

```sh
git commit -am "Add a new staking feature to improve transaction handling"
```

#### Step 8: Push to Your Fork and Submit a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, go to the `nuklaivm` repository on GitHub and submit a pull request. Describe your changes and link the pull request to any relevant issues.

#### Step 9: Code Review

Maintainers will review your pull request and may suggest changes. Engage in a conversation with maintainers and make necessary revisions to your pull requests.

Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch. Congratulations, and thank you for contributing!
