## Connecting to Nuklai App ðŸ’»

Creating a digital wallet is a crucial step for participating within Nuklai's marketplace. To do this, you can select a reputable wallet service like MetaMask.

The process involves downloading the wallet application, setting it up with secure login credentials, and safely storing your private keys. For a comprehensive tutorial on setting up and using MetaMask, you can visit the official MetaMask documentation [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask). This guide will provide step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth and secure wallet setup.

Once you have your wallet up and running, you will need a couple of things:

1. Switch your network to the [Avalanche network](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-to-add-the-avalanche-c-chain-to-metamask).
2. Have some AVAX in your wallet to pay for gas fees on the Avalanche network.
3. Have [$USDC.e](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/token/0xA7D7079b0FEaD91F3e65f86E8915Cb59c1a4C664) in your wallet on the Avalanche C-chain network.

And, youâ€™re good to go!
