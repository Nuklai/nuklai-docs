# Enriching Metadata on Community Dataset

Enriching the metadata of a dataset is a central part of the Nuklai data marketplace. By deeply enriching the metadata of a dataset you provide context about the data to users and artificial intelligence, and makes use of this data.

Simply put, this ensures that data becomes more useful for other users, which increases the chances of more people subscribing to the dataset. By allowing multiple contributors to enrich the metadata of community datasets, the quality of the data improves for all of its contributors and increases the number of their rewards.

This user guide will guide you through the steps for metadata enrichment to community datasets. If you wish to contribute data to community datasets, follow the guide on data contributions.

When you visit the Nuklai data marketplace and browse datasets, you will encounter a section within the details of the dataset that allows you to either contribute metadata or contribute data.

Before you decide if it's worth contributing metadata to the dataset, you need to know how much revenue the community dataset manager (initial publisher) charges for the management of the community dataset. If you would like to contribute metadata you should look to the Metadata shares percentage. This is the percentage of revenue that will be distributed between all metadata contributors.

If, for example, a subscription of $1000 is sold and metadata contributors get 10% of all revenue, then $100 is distributed among all metadata contributors. Let's say that Metadata Contributor 1, contributed metadata and Metadata Contributor 2 contributed metadata as well. Then Contributor 1 will earn 50% of $100 and Contributor 2 will earn 50% of $100.

Once you want to start the process of contributing metadata enrichments, you click on the Contribute Metadata button.

You will see two tabs:

- Schema, where you will be able to view the schema, the existing metadata and a way to edit the metadata of the dataset.
- View Sample: a few sample records so you can get a grasp of the data within the dataset in order to help you improve the metadata.

In order to add a tag to the metadata, click the three dots [...] next to tags. You will now be asked to add tags to the column within the dataset. Tags are meant to provide an alternative definition of the column you are enriching.

For example, the column "City" can be enriched with tags such as: Town, Capital City, Principal City, Metropolis. These are all alternative definitions for the column "City". You add a tag by typing and then hitting Enter on your keyboard to confirm. To save the tags, click on the blue tick to save or on the red cross to cancel. You will now be able to view the tags that you have added to the column.

In order to add a description to the column, you click the three dots [...] next to the description. You are now able to provide a deeper context about the column.

For example, the column "City" only has capital cities and refers to the capital cities where holiday accommodations are based. So we can add this as a description to our metadata. When you want to save the description, click on the blue tick to save or the red cross to cancel. You are now able to view the description that you have added to the column.

Repeat this process for as many columns as you wish within the dataset. After you have completed your contribution, you should write a message to the publisher of the dataset. It is recommended that you clearly explain the changes you have applied to the metadata, as this increases the chance of your contribution being accepted.

Click the Send request button and sign the transaction in your wallet to finalize the request.

Congratulations, a request to enrich the metadata has now been sent to the dataset publisher. You can now view your pending request in the Contribution Request page.

The dataset publisher will now receive a notification to review your request for contribution to the metadata of the dataset.

They are able to see:

- Schema: the current schema of the dataset, including the already existing tags and descriptions.
- Updated schema: the changes you have made to the metadata and if the request is accepted they will be the new contents of the dataset.

</div>

Publishers can either choose to accept or reject your request. If they decide to reject the request it is mandatory for them to write a message and give a reason why the request was rejected. If they accept the request a message is optional. The request is finalized when the publisher signs a transaction in your wallet.This is also the moment when the metadata of the dataset is updated.

You will receive a notification if the publisher accepted or rejected your request. In the Contribution Request page you will now see that the status of your request is either "approved" or "rejected".

If your request was approved you are now earning revenue with your contributed metadata. In the My Datasets page you will be able to claim any revenue that is generated.

Congratulations, by following this guide you have contributed a metadata enrichment to a dataset and are now eligible to earn rewards on it.
