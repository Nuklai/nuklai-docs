# Enriching Metadata

Enriching the metadata of a dataset is a central part of the Nuklai data marketplace. By deeply enriching the metadata of your dataset, you provide context about the data to users and artificial intelligence, and makes use of this data. Simply put, this ensures your data becomes more useful for other users, which increases the chances even more people will subscribe to your datasets.

This user guide will guide you through the steps of enriching the metadata of your dataset.

To start enriching the metadata of your dataset, you will need to have a datasets in the status "draft" or "published" on the Nuklai data marketplace. Follow this guide on publishing data if you haven't published a dataset yet.

When you want to start enriching the metadata of your dataset, go to the my datasets page and click the edit dataset button (pencil icon).

Click the edit button on the "Metadata" card, you will now see two tabs:

- Tree view: here you can start editing the metadata of your dataset, by adding tags and descriptions to each column of your dataset. You will also be able to delete certain fields from your dataset if you did not publish the dataset yet.
- View Sample: view a sample of the data from your dataset to understand the context of the data in detail.

## Metadata view

When your dataset is still in the status "draft" you will be able to still delete columns from your dataset before publishing. The delete button (trash bin icon) will be red when you are able to delete the column and gray when you won't be able to delete the column anymore.

Click the delete button (trash bin icon) and click confirm to delete the column from your dataset. The update is now being processed and can take a while. This action is irreversible, if you deleted a field by mistake we recommend you to delete the complete dataset and start the upload process again.

## Adding a tag to metadata

To add a tag to the metadata, click the three dots [...] next to tags. You will now be asked to add tags to the column within the dataset. Tags are meant to provide an alternative definition of the column you are enriching.

For example, the column "City" can be enriched with tags such as: Town, Capital City, Principal City, Metropolis. These are all alternative definitions for the column "City". You add a tag by typing and then hitting Enter on your keyboard to confirm. To save the tags, click on the blue tick to save or on the red cross to cancel. You will now be able to view the tags that you have added to the column.

To also add a description to the column, you click the three dots [...] next to description. You are now able to provide a deeper context about the column.

For example, the column "City" only has capital cities and refers to the capital cities where holiday accommodations are based. So we can add this as a description to our metadata. When you want to save the description, click on the blue tick to save or the red cross to cancel. You are now able to view the description that you have added to the column.

Repeat this process for each column in your dataset.

Congratulations! You have now successfully enriched the metadata of your dataset.
