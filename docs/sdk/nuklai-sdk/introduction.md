# Introduction to Nuklai SDK

## Overview of Nuklai SDK

The Nuklai SDK is the official SDK designed to facilitate interaction with the Nuklai blockchain.

Built on top of the Hyperchain SDK, it provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Nuklai blockchain.

This SDK serves as a bridge between developers and the complex blockchain infrastructure, offering
intuitive APIs and streamlined workflows for common blockchain operations. Whether you're building a
simple token transfer application or a complex decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, the Nuklai SDK
provides the necessary building blocks to bring your vision to life.

## Purpose and Key Features

The primary purpose of the Nuklai SDK is to simplify the process of developing applications on the Nuklai blockchain.
It achieves this through a range of features designed to enhance developer productivity and application performance:

1. **Seamless Blockchain Interaction**: Provides easy-to-use methods for querying blockchain state, submitting transactions, and managing assets.

2. **Asset Management**: Offers comprehensive tools for creating, minting, transferring, and burning tokens on the Nuklai network.

3. **Staking and Delegation**: Supports native token staking and delegation operations, enabling participation in network consensus and reward mechanisms.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Implements WebSocket connections for real-time blockchain updates, including new blocks and transaction confirmations.

5. **Cross-Chain Operations**: Facilitates interoperability with other blockchains in the Avalanche ecosystem through Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM).

6. **Emission Balancer Integration**: Provides methods to interact with Nuklai's unique Emission Balancer, allowing for dynamic management of token supply and rewards.

7. **Type Safety**: Written in TypeScript, offering robust type checking and enhanced IDE support for a better development experience.

8. **Extensibility**: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing developers to easily extend and customize SDK functionality for specific use cases.

## Relationship with the Hyperchain SDK

1. **Inherited Functionality**: The Nuklai SDK inherits core functionalities from the Hyperchain SDK, including efficient transaction handling, block management, and network communication protocols.

2. **Enhanced Customization**: While leveraging Hyperchain SDK, the Nuklai SDK extends its capabilities with Nuklai-specific features and optimizations.

3. **Seamless Integration**: Applications built with the Nuklai SDK can easily interact with other Avalanche subnets and the broader Avalanche ecosystem, thanks to the shared underlying architecture.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The Nuklai SDK benefits from the performance enhancements and optimizations present in the Hyperchain SDK, ensuring efficient and scalable blockchain operations.

5. **Unified Development Experience**: Developers familiar with the Hyperchain SDK will find the transition to Nuklai SDK seamless, as it maintains similar patterns and conventions while introducing Nuklai-specific features.

By building on the Hyperchain SDK, the Nuklai SDK combines the power and flexibility of Avalanche's technology stack with tailored features for the Nuklai blockchain, offering developers a comprehensive toolkit for building next-generation decentralized applications.
