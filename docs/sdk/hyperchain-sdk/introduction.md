# Introduction to Hyperchain SDK

The Hyperchain SDK is a sophisticated JavaScript/TypeScript library designed for interacting with HyperSDK-based Virtual Machines (VMs) on the Avalanche network. It provides a high-level interface to the low-level functionalities of Avalanche's HyperSDK, enabling developers to build and interact with custom blockchain solutions built on HyperSDK efficiently.

Developed by Nuklai Protocol, this SDK serves as a bridge between developers and the intricate workings of HyperSDK-based blockchains, offering a more accessible and flexible approach to blockchain development on Avalanche.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Management**: Sophisticated handling of blockchain transactions with support for custom action types.
- **Block Structure Handling**: Efficient management and interaction with blockchain block structures.
- **Fee Calculation**: Advanced, multi-dimensional fee calculation system accounting for bandwidth, compute, and storage operations.
- **Extensible Authentication System**: Support for multiple cryptographic schemes including BLS and ED25519.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time blockchain network interaction for submitting transactions and receiving updates.
- **Custom Action Implementation**: Ability to define and integrate custom blockchain actions.
- **State Management**: Flexible state management system for custom VM implementations.
- **Real-time Blockchain Monitoring**: Tools for listening to and processing blockchain events in real-time.

## System Requirements

To use the Hyperchain SDK, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version `20.x` or higher
- **TypeScript**: Version `4.x` or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ recommended)
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM, 8GB or more recommended for larger projects
- **Storage**: At least 1GB of free disk space for SDK and dependencies

## Blockchain Compatibility

The Hyperchain SDK is specifically designed to work with hyperchains built using the HyperSDK.
